# Learning Process

## 1. **What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

* The Feynman Technique is a way to learn any concept that can be explained in simple manners, identify the gaps while explaining and improve your gaps based on that.


## 2. **In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**


* she explained about that how minds work in two ways that are, Focused mode and Diffused mode.

* Procrastination: The first way is you can just kind of keep working a way through it, that within a few minutes, it actually will disappear. The second way is just to turn attention away and guess what you feel better.

* Using the Pomodoro technique as it turns out all you need to do is get a timmer that works.

* Another key to keeping exercise within a matter of few days can increase our ability to both learn and to remember.

* Test ourselves all the time.

* Another key to understanding alone is enough to build mastery of the material.


## 3. **What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

* **Active Modes:**
  
   * In active mode, you are paying more attention to one thing at a time. For example,
     you are trying to figure out  some coding problems, or learning words from different languages.

   * When you are focusing, you are putting specific parts of the brain to work. Which parts
are working depends on what you are doing. 

   * When you are trying to learn something new, you must first focus intently on it to “turn on” those parts of the brain and get the learning process started.


* **Diffused Modes:**
    
    * Diffuse mode is when your mind is relaxed and free. You’re thinking about nothing in particular. 
    
    * When you are in diffuse mode, you are gently using other parts of the brain that are mostly different from the parts you use when you are focusing.

## 4. **According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?**

* Deconstruct the skill: look into the skill and break it into smaller things and practice.

* Learn enough to self-correct: just self-learning is enough actual practice and correcting by ourselves.

* Remove practice barriers: remove all distractions that are keeping you from practicing.

* Practice for 20 hours: whenever starting a new learning skill brings initial frustration, you will be able to overcome that frustration barrier and practice well to learn a skill.


## 5. **What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

* Applying the Pomodoro technique to my workflow.

* If I am stuck on a problem instead of doing that problem, I will take a small break and then start with a fresh mind setup. 

* Taking proper sleep and eating healthy food. 

* I will practice some exercises as they can improve my learning ability.
